# **Unconditional Happiness Emersion Experience**

## Why Are You Coming?

**Have you ever thought ...**

**"I will be happy ... **

* If only this situation were different ... 

* If only my husband/wife/partner would act differently ... 

* If only my children were better behaved ...

* When I get that promotion ...

* When I can afford to retire to the south of Spain ...

* When I lose weight ...

* When I have more confidence ...

* When I'm better qualified

* If I could achieve enlightenment ...

* If I were a better parent / teacher / coach / dancer ...

* If more people liked me

* When I win the lottery!

Have you noticed - these are all versions of what we might call the "I'll be happy when..." trap that we all fall into from time to time - or all the time.

But what if we've innocently got it the wrong way round?  

What if our happiness, our wellbeing, our peace of mind doesn't depend on what we currently think it does?

What would be the implications of that?

What would become
available to you, if you knew, in your bones that that was true?

**Imagine yourself... **

\*      Being free of the need for
things to be different, in order for you to be happy

\*     
Loving
the life that you live, unconditionally

\*      Doing the things you want to do,
without feeling like your happiness or wellbeing depends on the outcome

Join Anne and Vivienne
for this five-day retreat in the beautiful and relaxed setting of the Camping
Beau Rivage, in Navarrenx in the picturesque Béarn region of the French
Pyrenees. 

Together we will explore
the unconditional nature of happiness, of wellbeing and resilience, and of
peace of mind.  Can we guarantee you'll
see something new about your own "I'll be happy when..."? No (because we're not
in charge of your insights or realisations) but we guarantee we'll point you in
the most helpful direction to see something that could literally set you free.

P.S. there is NOTHING
you can throw at us that is an exception to this.  From childlessness to relationship woes, to a
traumatic past experience, we will help you to see that your happiness now and
in the future is completely independent of any of those things.
