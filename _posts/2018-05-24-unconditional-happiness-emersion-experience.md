# **Unconditional Happiness Emersion Experience**

## What's It All About?

**Have you ever thought ...**

**"I will be happy ... **

* If only this situation were different ... 

* If only my husband/wife/partner would act differently ... 

* If only my children were better behaved ...

* When I get that promotion ...

* When I can afford to retire to the south of Spain ...

* When I lose weight ...

* When I have more confidence ...

* When I'm better qualified

* If I could achieve enlightenment ...

* If I were a better parent / teacher / coach / dancer ...

* If more people liked me

* When I win the lottery!

Have you noticed - these are all versions of what we might call the "I'll be happy when..." trap that we all fall into from time to time - or all the time.

But what if we've innocently got it the wrong way round?  

What if our happiness, our wellbeing, our peace of mind doesn't depend on what we currently think it does - but is in fact our default state of being?

What would be the implications of that?

What would become available to you - what would you experience - if you knew, in your bones that was true?

**Imagine yourself... **

FREE - of any need for things to be different, in order for you to BE HAPPY NOW

FREE - to LOVE YOUR LIFE - unconditionally

FREE - to DO THINGS YOU LOVE TO DO - without imagining your happiness or your wellbeing depend on any particular outcome.

Join Anne and Vivienne ...
for a relaxed and fun five-day deep immersion experience - in the beautiful and relaxed setting of the Camping Beau Rivage, in the ancient walled town of Navarrenx at the foot of the French Pyrenees. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e56fe378-31cd-422d-853c-38553ab7ec61.jpg)

Together we will explore - and experience deeply - the unconditional nature of happiness, of wellbeing, of resilience and of peace of mind.  

Can we guarantee you'll see something new about your own "I'll be happy when..."? 

No (because we're not in charge of your insights or realisations) but we guarantee we'll point you in the most helpful direction to see something that could literally set you free.

P.S. There is absolutely NOTHING you can throw at us that is an exception to this - our natural way of being and experiencing happiness.  

From childlessness - to relationship woes, from anxieties about your body, your health, your finances and the future - to traumatic past experience - we will help you to see - and to deeply experience - that your happiness now and in the future is completely independent of any of those things.
